# Settin AC6 for quick flashing the micro controller with cheap STlink v2

The Hardware reset somhow doesn't work, that it is neccesary to change the settings to soft reset

However, the latest version of Ac6 SW for STM32 I started to work with offers the easiest option to set the software system reset. Go to the menu

Run->Debug Configuration

In the tab “Debug” in “Configuration Script” press the button “Show Generator Options...”.
There change “Hardware Reset” to “Software System Reset”. This will automatically change the line in .cfg script to “reset_config none”.
Press Apply and Close.
